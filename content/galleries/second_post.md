Prepare the Filter: Fold the paper filter into a cone shape and rinse it in the Hario dripper with water just off the boil (about 205°F) to eliminate paper flavor and to heat up the mug or carafe you are brewing into. Discard the rinse water.
Add Coffee: Grind 21 grams (about 3 tablespoons) of coffee to be about as fine as kosher salt. Add the coffee to your brewer.
Blooming: Saturate the grounds with water right off the boil (about 205°F). Use just enough water to cover the grounds. Let it bloom for 15 seconds. The coffee should raise up and bubble a bit.
Pour Water: Pour water in a slow, even spiral, adding water every 10 to 15 seconds for an even extraction. Pour over the dark spots and avoid the light ones. You can pour up to 110g, then after counting around a minute, pour up to 200g, and give it a light stir to get rid of any harshness, and let it flow a bit.
Finish Brewing: The brewing process should be completed within 2 to 4 minutes. Once the coffee has finished brewing, discard the grounds.
Enjoy: Your coffee is now ready to enjoy.
